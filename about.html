            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>SMARA was founded by Patricia Tikasingh, in 2004.</p>
                    <p>As a cancer survior herself, Pat experienced first-hand the need for greater support for patients experiencing a cancer diagnosis 
                        and treatment, and also for those surviving or needing end-of-life care.
                    <p>Now working with team of up to 60 volunteers (including members of the local community, survivors, care
                        professionals and local business people), SMARA is here to support the people of South Trinidad during their cancer journey.</p>
                    <p>We are a not-for-profit organisation.  All of our services are provided free of charge.</p>
                    <p>We are local, and we are here for you!</p>
